    "The [Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)](https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/irspec/) survey provides infrared-wavelength high-resolution spectroscopy for over 650,000 unique stars from the Milky Way and nearby dwarf galaxies. APOGEE collected data between 2011 - 2020 as part of the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) project](https://www.sdss4.org). APOGEE data is now available at the [Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu) through the [SDSS Legacy Archive at MAST](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/SDSS/The+SDSS+Legacy+Archive+at+MAST). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook tutorial, we will demonstrate how to access APOGEE data at MAST using Python. One APOGEE star, a Cepheid Variable named `V1154-Cyg` will be used to demonstrate the basics of how to download and plot APOGEE data. We will then combine this APOGEE spectrum with light curves from the TESS mission, also accessible from MAST, to study this variable star."
